## ðŸ§ª How to Test the New Features

### **1. Test Featured Materials (Starter 5)**
1. Open your app and navigate to the ItemGatheringScreen
2. You should see only 5 materials initially (the featured ones)
3. These should be: writing utensil, paper, spoon, cup, toilet paper

### **2. Test Load More Materials**
1. Click the "Add items to unlock more games" button
2. Additional materials should load (like spatula, marshmallows, etc.)
3. Button should change to "All items loaded" with checkmark

### **3. Test Real-Time Game Counting**
1. Select/deselect materials on the ItemGatheringScreen
2. Watch the progress bar update in real-time
3. The count should show actual available games, not fake calculation

### **4. Test Enhanced Game Filtering**
1. Select only featured materials and proceed to game selection
2. Games should be filtered based on actual material requirements
3. Games requiring non-selected materials should not appear

### **5. Test Database Views (Optional)**
Run these queries in your Supabase dashboard:
```sql
-- View featured materials
SELECT * FROM featured_materials;

-- View game requirements with alternatives
SELECT * FROM game_materials_detailed WHERE game_title = 'Cup Catch';

-- View game requirements summary
SELECT * FROM game_requirements_summary LIMIT 10;
```

## ðŸ”§ Test Script Available

Run the test script to verify database setup:
```bash
cd /Users/alexgunnerson/Documents/App\ Dev/Tango!/TangoApp
node test-new-features.js
```

## ðŸ“Š What You Should See

### **Before (Old System):**
- All materials shown at once

- âœ… "Load more" button for additional materials  
- âœ… Real-time game count based on actual filtering
