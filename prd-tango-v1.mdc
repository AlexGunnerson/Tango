Product Requirements Document: Tango!
Version: 1.1
Date: August 31, 2025

1. Introduction & Vision

1.1 Core Concept
Tango is a mobile application for iOS and Android that offers hundreds of fun, simple mini-games designed to be played with household items. The app aims to facilitate real-world connections and create memorable experiences by removing the complexity of traditional board games.

1.2 Vision
Fast & Simple: Allow users to learn any game in under two minutes and start playing immediately.
Play Your Way: Offer multiple game modes, including competitive duels (1 vs 1), team play (2 vs 2), cooperative challenges, and tournaments.
Connecting People: Foster genuine interaction and shared laughter, whether players are in the same room or connecting remotely.

2. Target Audience & User Personas
The primary target audience for Tango consists of young couples and families looking for easy and engaging ways to connect and have fun together.
Persona 1: The Couple (Chloe & Ben, ages 28-35)
Goal: Find fun, spontaneous activities to do on a weeknight that don't involve screen time. They enjoy friendly competition.
Pain Point: They are often too tired after work for complex board games and find themselves defaulting to watching TV.
How Tango Helps: Provides quick, low-effort games that spark laughter and connection. The "1 vs 1" Tango mode is perfect for their competitive dynamic.
Persona 2: The Family (The Miller Family, parents ages 35-45 with kids ages 6-12)
Goal: Find an activity that everyone in the family can enjoy together, regardless of age.
Pain Point: It's difficult to find games that are simple enough for the youngest child but still engaging for the parents and older sibling.
How Tango Helps: Offers a wide variety of games, and modes like "Co-Op" and "Tournament" are perfect for family game nights, ensuring everyone can participate.

4. Technical Specifications & Non-Functional Requirements

4.1 Technical Stack
Frontend: Expo React Native with Tailwind CSS
Backend & Database: Supabase
Target Platforms: iOS (iPhone) and Android (specifically Samsung devices, with general Android compatibility)
Development Environment: Cursor AI Code Editor

4.2 Non-Functional Requirements
Offline Capability: The core gameplay experience (browsing and playing downloaded games) must be available without an active internet connection. Game assets (videos, instructions) will need to be bundled with the app or downloaded ahead of time.
Performance: The app must be responsive and smooth, with minimal loading times, especially during game countdowns and transitions.
Usability: The interface must be intuitive and easy to navigate for non-technical users of all ages.

5. User Flow: 1 vs 1 Tango
Player Selection: User taps "1 vs 1," enters Player 2's name, or connects to a friend's profile.
Punishment Selection: Both players agree on a randomly generated punishment or opt out.
Item Gathering: After the opponent is selected, a screen lists the household items needed for a set of random games. A button labeled "Items Gathered" with a checkbox signals readiness. If a user doesn't have an item, they can tap a button to remove it. The app will suggest alternatives or remove the item from the game selection pool.
Game Selection: An animation plays, shuffling and randomly selecting a game.  The game chosen will only use the items players have confirmed they have.
Instructions: The selected game's title appears along with a description of how to play the game.  Tapping the video button on this screen plays a short video tutorial on how to play the game.
Gameplay: Tapping the "Tango!" button on the instructions screen starts a five-second countdown with sound effects. The gameplay screen displays the name of the game at the top in big text, below that in smaller text it will display whose turn it is.  Middle of the screen will have a big timer and below the timer there will be a pause timer and reset timer button. A sound effect signals the end of the round / time is up.
Scoring: A screen appears where the user selects the winner of the round. In games like marshmallow scoop where the users enter how many marshmallows are in the bowl after their turn, the app can determine the winner. A scoreboard in the bottom-right corner updates with the new score.  When the users are done reviewing their score, they can hit the ‘Round 2’ button.
Next Round: The app shuffles to select the next game. If a player has a two-game lead, a handicap is applied to them for the next round.  The handicap is announced after the user with a 2 game lead clicks the tango button, a pop up card will pop up letting the user know they have a handicap and explaining the handicap to them.
Conclusion: This flow repeats until a player wins three games. A final screen declares the winner with a celebratory confetti animation.  The loser is then prompted to complete the pre-selected punishment. A Punishment button will appear on the screen. When the user selects the Punishment button, a card will pop up explaining what the loser must do. For example, if a winner's speech was selected, the card would say: "<loser name> must read the Concession Speech below" Below this message, a pre-populated speech will be provided for the loser to read aloud. The speech will be about 30 seconds of humorous and over-the-top praise for the winner.  Users can then choose to "Play Again" or select a "Back to Home".
